Fix for CORS_ORIGINS Error

The error happens because CORS_ORIGINS is empty or invalid. I've updated the validator to handle this, but you still need to fix your .env file.

STEPS TO FIX:

1. Pull the latest code:
   git pull origin main

2. Check your .env file:
   grep CORS_ORIGINS .env
   
   If you see:
   - CORS_ORIGINS= (empty) → Remove this line entirely OR set it to:
     CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
   
   - CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"] (JSON format) → Change to:
     CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
   
   - CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000 (correct) → You're good!

3. Restart services:
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d

4. Try again:
   docker compose run --rm manager python init_db.py

QUICK FIX:
If you don't need custom CORS_ORIGINS, just remove the CORS_ORIGINS line from .env entirely. The default will be used automatically.

The validator fix is in the latest code, but you still need to fix your .env file format. Let me know if it works!
